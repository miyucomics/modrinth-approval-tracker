I make a lot of mods and a big annoyance is waiting for it to get approved, especially if there are people waiting on its release. That is why I have made this website! It's super lightweight and coded in pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the fun of it. No frameworks or libraries, just a simple UI using CSS and fetching data from Modrinth API using Javascript.

This site takes the last 50 (customizable via a search parameter called `sample`) mods approved on Modrinth, adds up how long it took for them to get approved, and divides it by the sample size to get a human-readable duration of average approval duration.

It also renders all the mods as little cards under, allowing you to see new mods scroll by. This includes your own mods when they get approved!
